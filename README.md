# Efficient-GPU-Implementation-of-Graph-Algorithms_POPProject

## Introduction
Graph algorithms are vital components in various
computational domains, handling tasks from social network
analysis to scientific simulations. As graph data’s scale and
complexity surge, the need for efficient implementations escalates.
Recently, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have emerged as
potent parallel computing devices, offering potential acceleration
for graph computations. However, exploiting GPUs necessitates
meticulous consideration of algorithm design, data structures,
and optimization techniques. This project proposes to investigate C++-based optimization of graph algorithms for both
GPU and CPU architectures, aiming for substantial performance
enhancements. Leveraging GPUs’ parallel processing and CPUs’
high single-thread performance, the project aims to provide
efficient solutions for processing large-scale graph data.
